Info :
A simple weather forecast app made visually pleasing .Made using HTML, CSS, PHP, JS.
Doing this package taught me a lot on how to work with api and how to make the page more attractive.
It was an learning opportunity and helped me to get a good grip on js and how to work with api.
Functionnality :
The functionality of the app is very simple. You need to enter the place name or the latitude and longitude of that place. The app will navigate you to a weather page where the 
background of the page will be a theme of the current weather of the page . You will also see the temperature and the description. Then you can see the entire details by navigating
through downward arrow mark. Also you can see the 5 day forecast of the place .
